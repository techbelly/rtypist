= rtypist

A weekend project, a bit of an experiment really, doing an almost line-by-line port of [Gnu Typist]:http://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/ to ruby.

It sort of works, though not everything is implemented, but you can install and run it with

    gem install rtypist
    rtypist

Don't look at the source code! It really is a near line-by-line port - so much less ruby-like than code that would have been written from scratch. One of the reasons I'm doing it is to practice refactoring.
